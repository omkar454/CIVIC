   - The system auto-prioritizes complaints using severity and community upvotes.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Verification and Assignment**
   - Admins verify the complaint for authenticity.
   - Once verified, it‚Äôs assigned to the relevant department automatically.
   - Department officers are notified instantly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Complaint Management**
   - Officers acknowledge the complaint.
   - They update its status (Open ‚Üí Acknowledged ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved/Rejected).
   - Officers upload media proof and comments for transparency.
   - Citizens can comment or upvote other complaints for visibility.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **SLA (Service Level Agreement) Tracking**
   - Each complaint has a time-bound SLA based on its priority level.
   - The system automatically flags delays and tracks department performance.
   - SLA dashboards are visible to both officers and admins.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **User Communication**
   - Citizens and officers can exchange comments on a complaint thread.
   - Both parties receive notifications when updates occur.
   - Admins can moderate and view conversation logs for quality control.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Voting and Community Impact**

   - Admin dashboards include analytics for department performance, SLA adherence, top complaint types, and citizen participation.
   - Officers can view their department‚Äôs performance metrics.

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Verification System**
